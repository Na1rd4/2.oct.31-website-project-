    <h1> How do we know global warming exist?</h1>
    <h2>While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in
      the past 10,000 years. Scientific information taken from natural sources such as ice cores, rocks, and tree rings
      and from modern equipment like satellites and instruments all show the signs of a changing climate. The current
      warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is
      proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced
      the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun’s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed
      the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and
      biosphere have occurred.

    <h1> Why is the world getting hot and just being weird?</h1>
    <h2> Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human expansion of the
      "greenhouse effect" — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space.

      Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere
      passes through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form of infrared heat.
      About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.</h2>
